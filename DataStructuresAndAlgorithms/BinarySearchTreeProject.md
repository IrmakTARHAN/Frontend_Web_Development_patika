## Binary Search Tree Project
This file contains the Binary Search Tree assignment from the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course by Irmak Tarhan from Patika.dev.

The array [7, 5, 1, 8, 3, 6, 0, 9, 4, 2] will be used to construct a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Below are the steps for building the tree:

1.The root of the tree is 7.

2.To its left is 5, and to its right is 8.

3.To the left of 5 is 1, and to its right is 6.

4.To the left of 1 is 0, and to its right is 3.

5.To the left of 3 is 2, and to its right is 4.

6.To the right of 8 is 9.

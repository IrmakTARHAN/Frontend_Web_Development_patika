# Merge Sort Project

This file contains the Merge Sort assignment from the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course by Irmak Tarhan from Patika.dev.

The array [16, 21, 11, 8, 12, 22] will be sorted using the Merge Sort algorithm.

## Below are the steps of the sorting process:

[16, 21, 11] [8, 12, 22] (The array is split into two equal halves.)

[16] [21, 11] [8] [12, 22] (Each half is further divided.)

[16] [21] [11] [8] [12] [22] (The array is broken down into single-element arrays.)

[16, 21] [11] [8, 12] [22] (The merging process begins, combining the single-element arrays.)

[11, 16, 21] [8, 12, 22] (The sorted sub-arrays are merged.)

[8, 11, 12, 16, 21, 22] (The final, sorted array is created.)

## Big-O Notation
The time complexity of the Merge Sort algorithm is O(n log n). This efficiency remains consistent regardless of whether the input array is already sorted, reversed, or completely random, making it a reliable and powerful sorting algorithm.

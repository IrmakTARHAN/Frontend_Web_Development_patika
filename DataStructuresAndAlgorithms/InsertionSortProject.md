# Insertion Sort Project
This file contains the Insertion Sort assignment from the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course by Umu Atakul from Patika.dev.

The array [22, 27, 16, 2, 18, 6] will be sorted using the Insertion Sort algorithm.

Below are the steps of the sorting process:

[2, 27, 16, 22, 18, 6]

[2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]

[2, 6, 16, 22, 18, 27]

[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

[2, 6, 16, 18, 22, 27]

## Big-O Notation
The Big-O notation for Insertion Sort is O(n 
2
 ).

Reminder:

 -Best Case: The element you are searching for is at the beginning of the array.

 -Average Case: The element you are searching for is in the middle of the array.

 -Worst Case: The element you are searching for is at the end of the array.

After the array is sorted, to which case does the number 18 belong?

**Answer: Average Case

Write the first 4 steps of the Insertion Sort for the array [7, 3, 5, 8, 2, 9, 4, 15, 6]:

**Answer:

[2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6]

[2, 3, 5, 8, 7, 9, 4, 15, 6]

[2, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 5, 15, 6]

[2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 8, 15, 6]
